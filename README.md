# Fikra Project - README 🚀

Welcome to the **FikraApp** project, a Python application for creating and managing quizzes. This project showcases your skills in project management, teamwork, and Python and Javascript development. The project will be carried out in groups of 5 students.

## Project Objective 🎯

The main goal of this project is to develop a Python application that allows the creation, administration, and completion of quizzes. The basic features include account creation to store individual score histories and the ability for an administrator to create quizzes, either directly or from a text file.

## Minimum Features 🌐

1. **Account Creation:** Implementation of the account creation feature to store individual score histories.
2. **Quiz Administration:** Ability for an administrative user to create quizzes directly or from a text file.
3. **Score Display:** The application should display the final score and correct answers for each authorized user.

## Additional Features 🚀

The project encourages the addition of extra features to enhance the user experience, such as:
- **Timer Functionality:** Addition of a timer feature to limit the response time for a quiz.
- **JSON Export:** Ability to export quizzes in JSON format.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Development of a graphical interface to improve accessibility and the user experience.

## Specifications 📝

The specifications are deliberately concise to allow you to take ownership of the project. It's up to your team to define a solid initial architecture. Use the SCRUM method to break down features into manageable tasks, each taking no more than 2 days.

## Example Application: FikraApp 📚

You can take inspiration from the example application "FikraApp" to guide the development of your project.
